# Simple packages

Some packages are simple enough that they fit withing simplified boundaries.
This folder contains those.

## Ideas

* Treat package as data instead of code. They can be generated with tooling
  more easily.
* Enforce 1:1 mapping between the attribute and pname.
* Get rid of the folder-structure taxonomy. Taxonomy doesn't map to a tree.
  Instead, use tags annotations on the packages.
* Introduce pkgs.mkSimplePackage.
